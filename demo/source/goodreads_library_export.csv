49099937,No Rules Rules: Netflix and the Culture of Reinvention,Reed Hastings,"Hastings, Reed",Erin Meyer,"=""0593152387""","=""9780593152386""",5,4.32,Random House Large Print Publishing,Paperback,464,2020,2020,2022/02/22,2022/02/15,,,read,"I’m lucky this year; almost all the books I have read until now are close to excellent. This one has been probably the best. The book talks about the culture at Netflix. It is perhaps more helpful for a manager and executive, but I did note a couple of topics that I consider very interesting.<br/><br/>The first one is giving and receiving feedback. I know that it is essential, but the text let me see that it is more than necessary; it is the best way to develop your skill inside your working environment. From now on, I will ask for more candid feedback right away.<br/><br/>The other is the keeper test. I will try as well to apply that. I’m sure it will sound weird to my managers, but with a previous explanation, It could be beneficial.<br/><br/>A fun fact is that the last part of the book directly uses the techniques that I learned from the previous book that I read, “The culture Map”. That was nice indeed.<br/><br/>After reading this one, I have decided that the next book will re-read radical candor. I read it some years ago, and I feel like now I’ll take more from it. So, that will come next!<br/><br/>See it in my blog: [josealobato.com](https://josealobato.com/reed-hastings-erin-meyer-no-rules-rules)",,,1,,,0,,,,,

I have already read many books about learning methodologies and how learning works in humans. But, I enjoyed these types of books and wanted to give another take on the subject.<br/><br/>During the first part of the book, I thought I had made a mistake starting it. Not only I wasn’t learning anything new, but the book felt slow. Thankfully, the second half of the book is much more enjoyable. Especially chapters 4 (Make learning secondary) and 5 (Teaching to learn) are exciting and inspiring. Nothing surprising but inspiring.<br/><br/>In general, and in the end, there is nothing new for me in the book, but it is a fine read. It is short and to the point, and I think it would make a perfect book as a first read on the subject. If you have not read any other essay on learning, this one could be a good entry point.<br/><br/>See it in my blog [josealobato.com](https://josealobato.com/peter-hollins-super-learning)",,,1,,,0,,,,,

You know that people's behaviour is affected by their culture and personality, but you are never sure what is showing in every moment. Somehow that is what this book is about.<br/><br/>It analyzes the different cultures and parametrizes them to allow readers to know what to expect in every type of culture. It gives you tools to handle and provide feedback from and to different cultures better.<br/><br/>It did help me to comprehend some experiences that I had in the past and understand and interact better with my current team. Currently, I work in a multicultural team with six different cultures; learning to communicate more effectively with them is a good skill that I want to learn and practice. I was surprised how fast I could apply what I learned in the book, identify my teammates' cultural traits, and see their personalities more clearly.<br/><br/>Recommend read for everyone; really, it is that useful.<br/><br/>See it in my blog: [josealobato.com](https://josealobato.com/erin-meyer-the-culture-map)",,,1,,,0,,,,,

I searched for new ways to communicate my agile ideas, and “coaching” sounds like it. And it was. <br/><br/>Agile is very easy to understand but hard to get, which is misleading. What is easy is the frameworks. They are very well designed and easy to grasp. You can start a team with SCRUM in a couple of Sprints if you teach them the ceremonies and their goals and how to manage springboard and backlog. But that is just the early beginning. Getting rid of all the bad habits and working as an efficient Agile team is another story entirely. It is even more complicated if your team does not “believe” in agile. Either way, they are already convinced that it will work, or they will only be when they see it. But, if they are unwilling to give it a try for real, prepare for a bumpy road. <br/><br/>The book is excellent if you are interested in understanding more about the Agile concepts and go deeper in how to go across explaining the concepts to your colleagues. I love when the author clarifies the differences between “Cooperation” and “Collaboration”. Most people can not differentiate both words, which is key to understanding how a teams work.<br/><br/>Since I’m so passionate about this subject, I wondered if I should switch careers and start coaching other teams after taking the needed courses. It is not the first time I put this question on the table. But, even though I love it, I love even more crafting software. So I’ll stay growing the way I’m doing now. But if my team wants to go beyond in their Agile path, I’m now more ready to help with that.<br/><br/>One last thing. Even though the book explains many exciting concepts and is well written, I do not think it is a book for somebody who wants to start with agile. The book will probably confuse you more than help you if you are new to agile. I would say it is an advance level book.<br/><br/>Did I say that I’m a fan of agile? :)<br/><br/>See it in my blog: [josealobato.com](https://josealobato.com/lyssa-adkins-coaching-agile-teams)",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Instead of using the actual historical events, create new ones that are more suitable for a book and do not involve real characters or situations.<br/><br/>Books like the Phoenix Project use that approach. With an artificial history, they give context to the problems that DevOps solve while providing a theoretical introduction to the DevOps current environment. Another book with similar approach is P Lencioni “The Ideal Team Player”.<br/><br/>If the writing is good, this has the effect of reading a good novel. The story is engaging, and you feel hooked because you know that these problems are real, and maybe you have already experienced similar situations. I am not an expert in DevOps, but I did identify several characters with real persons in my career. Also, many conditions described in the book feel like some of my own experiences.<br/><br/>It is a fantastic book that could be nicely complemented with the sequel by the same author titled “The DevOps Handbook”. I plan to read it next year, and anyway, I’ll probably reread this one first at the beginning of 2022.<br/><br/>See it in my blog: [josealobato.com](https://josealobato.com/gene-kim-the-phoenix-project/)",,,1,,,0,,,,,

The first attempt was 48 hours that I did without problems. For the last two weeks, I’m in, what the author name, the 24 hours protocol. It is intermittent fasting, including three full days a week.<br/><br/>I am a firm believer that fasting helps the body to heal and recover. I feel very well after 48h with just water (I did not even take my regular morning coffee). I plan to move to the 32 hours protocol in the following weeks. And when I am prepared, I’ll attempt five days fast.<br/><br/>My experience with fasting has been exactly as the author describes it. So I wholeheartedly recommend the book if you are interested in the subject.<br/><br/>For those that don’t know me, I do not need to lose weight. My BMI is 23. It is simply that I like to experiment with things that I feel could be good for me.

Adjusting some deviation that I took over the time that does not help on getting the most of the system. I always found the method exciting and useful, and now I do not conceive of my life without it. It is an integral part of the way I do things.
