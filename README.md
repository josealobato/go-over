# Work in progress

`go-over` is a tool to manage data in my personal blog.

At the moment I am migrating from a bunch of python scrips to a proper package. The base code is already migrated and working and next step will be the test. I'll be using the a _projects_ and the _issues_ section to control the migration and the later development.

The tool already contains help so you can install localy and play with it if you wish:

```bash
pip3 install <path to the folder of the package>
go-over -h
```

> NOTE: I'm new to python, so any advice on how to do this better is highly welcome.
