# What is "go over"?

Go over is a python package desing to help managing data for a blog hosted with Jekyll. The package is designed as a CLI suite of tools, which means that it will contain several independent tools. At the moment though it contains only one (`goodreads`). Once installed you can get detail help of use by invoking the tools with no parameters.

```bash
go-over
```

## Installation

The package is provided as a [Pypy](https://pypi.org/project/pip-packaging/) installable package. Use `pip3` to install it:

```bash
pip3 install go-over
```

As always it is recommended to use a virtual environment.

## go-over tool: `goodreads`

The first tool provided by `go-over` is a manager for data exported from [Goodreads.com](https://www.goodreads.com). Goodreads provides a feature to [export](https://www.goodreads.com/review/import) your library as a CSV. The tool can process that CVS file and generate JSON files to easily consume on using [liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) from your [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) blog.

You will need to pass the CVS file to the tool:

```bash
go-over goodreads -g goodreads_library_export.csv
```

This will generate the files in a folder with the name `./results`. But call also tell where to generate the resulting files with the `-r` option:

```bash
go-over goodreads -g goodreads_library_export.csv -r _data
```

Unfortunatelly the data coming from [Goodreads.com](https://www.goodreads.com) is uncomplete or does not contains all the information to customize your blog, but no worries, you can easiy complement the that with your own data. To do so you can provide a complementary JSON file with the `-c` paramenter. If that file is not there, `go-over` will generate it for you from the data on the original CVS file. Also you can force the generation of this file any time with the flag `--force_complementary_rewrite` or `-f`. Note that forcing the generation will only override the existing data but not data will be lost from the complementary file.

The complementary JSON file will have the form:

```json
{
    "books": [
        {
            "id": "17255186",
            "title": "The Phoenix Project: A Novel About IT, DevOps, and Helping Your Business Win",
            "language": "EN",
            "tags": "fiction, devops",
            "format": "audiobook",
            "my_review_url": "/gene-kim-the-phoenix-project/",
            "read_dates": [
                "2021/12/11"
            ],
            "is_favourite": true
        },
    ]
}
```

Where:

* `language`: Here you can specified the language you use to read/listen to the book/audiobook.
* `title`: Book title. Sometimes the titles coming from the CSV are very long. Here you can short them.
* `tags`: You can add a list of tags to apply to the book.
* `format`: `audiobook/softcover/hardcover`
* `my_review_url`: a partial like to you review of the book in Jekyll.
* `read_dates`: you might have read multiple times the book, here you can add al list of the dates with the format `YYYY/MM/dd`. If you set this value to `null` the date on the original file will be used, that is the date of the last read. Use this fields if you have read it multiple times.
* `is_favourite`: you can mark books as favourites. When favourites exist a `JSON` file for the favourites will be generated.
Any data provided in the complementary file will override the one on the original CVS file.

You can explore the CLI help of this tool with:

```bash
go-over goodreads --help
```

## Setting up the dev environment

I'm using a python virtual environment and I have exported the configuration to a file called `venv_requirements.txt`. To start working follow these steps:

1. On the root folder, create the environment if you do not have it already with: `python3 -m venv .venv`
2. Start the environment: `source .venv/bin/activate`
3. Install the requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Install the local package to edit: `pip install -e ./`

You should be ready to go!

With that done you can run the test with: `pytest`
To run the test allowing for prints (not capturing) and inspecting fixtures run: `pytest -v -s --setup-show`

When you finish, stop the virtual environment with: `deactivate`

## Run with demo data

In the `demo/source` folder you will find data to do a demo run of the tool and see how it works. To do so follow these steps:

1. (If not done already) Set up the environment `python3 -m venv .venv`
2. Activate the environment: `source .venv/bin/activate`
3. (If not done already) Install the requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Install the local package to edit: `pip install -e ./`

```bash
go-over -v goodreads -g ./demo/source/goodreads_library_export.csv -c ./demo/source/goodreads_complement.json -r ./demo/results
```

After doing this, in the results folder you will have all the generated files:

```bash
> ls -la demo/results/
books_by_tags.json
books_favourites.json
books_read_2011.json
books_read_2018.json
books_read_2019.json
books_read_2020.json
books_read_2021.json
books_read_2022.json
books_read_no_date.json
books_reading.json
books_stats.json
books_to_read.json
```

## Developer note

> NOTE: I'm new to python, so any advice on how to do this better is highly welcome.
